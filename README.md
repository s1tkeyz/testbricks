# TestBricks


### What is this?

TestBricks is a lightweight and easy to use platform for knowledge testing programs.
This repository provides a library of classes and functions, that can help you to create
programs with GUI, using qt5 or GTK, for example.
Main language of this project in Python, but I will develop a C++ version very soon.


### How can I use it?

There are two branches: *python* and *cpp*. 
Each of them contains source code of TestBricks library on the respective languages.
You can download them and import to your project.


### Code documentation

As I told, this project has two branches in Python and C++ languages, but
this documentation is actual for both branches because methods and classes are same.
*python* branch has two files: *init.py* and *core.py*.

*cpp* branch is empty now.



#### Classes description

**Question (text, answer, value)** - Declares question structure.

text (str) - text (formulation) of the question.

answer (str) - correct answer.

value (int) - weight of the question (points, that will be added to student's test score in case of correct answer).


It has two methods:

*to_dict()* - returns a **dictionary** built from the question data.

*to_list()* - returns a **list** from the question data.



**Test (name, subject, author, questions, allotted_time)** - Declares test structure.

name (str) - test name.

subject (str) - subject of the test.

author (str) - author name.

questions (list) - array of Question objects.

allotted_time (int) - allotted time in seconds.


It has three methods:

*to_list()* - returns **list** of test questions.

*to_dict()* - returns **dictionary** built from the test data.

*save_to_file(path)* - saves test data to file using JSON format (path (str) - path for saving).




#### Global functions description

*get_test_from_file(path)* - returns **Test** object, built from file (path (str) - path to file).
